# Three Boxes 

A simple interactive web project built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**.

## Idea
The page starts with three colored boxes (red, green, blue).  
When a box is clicked:
- A copy of the box is created and added to the page
- The original box becomes inactive (reduced opacity and disabled click)

## Technologies Used
- HTML
- CSS
- JavaScript (DOM Manipulation & Events)

## What I Practiced
- DOM element selection
- Event handling
- Cloning elements dynamically
- Working with event listeners
